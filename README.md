Agents: agent-based modeling in Julia

Agents is inspired by Mesa, an agent-based modeling framework for Python.

It allows users to quickly create agent-based models using built-in core components (such as spatial grids and agent schedulers) or customized implementations; visualize them; and analyze their results. Its goal is to be the Julia-based alternative to NetLogo, Repast, or MASON.

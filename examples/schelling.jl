#= This is an implementation of Schelling's segregation model

* There are agents on a grid
* Agents are of two different kinds. They can represent different groups.
* Only one agent can be at a node on the grid.
  * Each node represents a house, and only one a person/family can live in a house.
* Agents are happy even if a majority of their neighbors are of a different kind.
* If they are unhappy, they move to a random empty node until they are happy.

This model shows that even a slight preference for being around neighbors of the same kind leads to segregated
neighborhoods.
